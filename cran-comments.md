## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the call to `\dontrun{}` from `geom_line_mcc()`.

* Updated other documentation to ensure exported functions that were previously missing examples now have examples.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

* This is a new release.

* URL flagged as possibly invalid for a badge in README.md - URL will become valid after package published to CRAN.
