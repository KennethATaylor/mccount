\title{Filter \code{mcc} object by groups}
\usage{
filter_mcc(x, groups)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A grouped \code{mcc} object}

\item{groups}{Character vector of group names to include}
}
\value{
An \code{mcc} object containing only the specified groups
}
\description{
For grouped \code{mcc} objects, extracts results for specified groups only.
This is useful for focusing on specific groups of interest or creating

\examples{
# Create sample data with groups
library(dplyr)
df <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8),

                "Treatment", "Treatment", "Control", "Control",
                "Placebo", "Placebo", "Placebo")
) |>
  arrange(id, time)

# Grouped analysis
mcc_full <- mcc(df, "id", "time", "cause", by = "treatment")

# Show all groups
mcc_groups(mcc_full)

# Filter to specific groups
mcc_filtered <- filter_mcc(mcc_full, c("Control", "Treatment"))
mcc_groups(mcc_filtered)  # Only "Control" and "Treatment"

# Plot the filtered mcc object
plot(mcc_filtered)

# Clean up
