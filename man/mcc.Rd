\usage{
mcc(
  data,
  id_var,
  time_var,
  cause_var,
  by = NULL,
  method = c("equation", "sci"),
  tstart_var = NULL,
  adjust_times = TRUE,
  time_precision = 1e-06,
  include_details = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(\code{data.frame} or \code{tbl_df})\cr
A \code{data.frame} or tibble containing the required variables}

\item{id_var}{(\code{string})\cr
Name of the column containing participant identifiers}

\item{time_var}{(\code{string})\cr
Name of the column containing follow-up times}

\item{cause_var}{(\code{string})\cr
Name of the column containing event indicator values (1 = event of
interest, 2 = competing risk, 0 = censoring)}

\item{by}{(\code{string}, optional)\cr
Name of the column to group by for calculating MCC within subgroups.
If provided, MCC will be calculated separately for each level of this
variable}

\item{method}{(\code{string})\cr
Method to use for MCC calculation. Either \code{"equation"} (default) or
\code{"sci"} (sum of cumulative incidence)}

\item{tstart_var}{(\code{string})\cr
Name of the column containing start times of follow-up for incorporating
left truncation. Only allowed to be specified when \code{method = "sci"}. If
\code{NULL} (default), a constant value of \code{0} is used in calculation (i.e.,
right truncation only)}

\item{adjust_times}{(\code{logical})\cr
If \code{TRUE} (default), automatically adjusts times to account for outcome
events and competing risk events occurring at the same time}

\item{time_precision}{(\code{numeric})\cr
Precision used for adjusting simultaneous events (default: 1e-6). Must
be a positive numeric value}

\item{include_details}{(\code{logical})\cr
Whether to include detailed calculation tables and intermediate objects
in the output. Default is \code{TRUE}, which returns all calculation details.
Setting to \code{FALSE} returns only the final MCC estimates, making the
function more efficient for bootstrapping}
}
\value{
When \code{by} is NULL (single group analysis):

When \code{include_details = TRUE} (default), a list with method-specific components:

For \code{method = "equation"}:
\itemize{
\item \code{mcc_final}: A tibble with columns for \code{time} and \code{mcc}
\item \code{mcc_table}: A tibble with detailed calculation steps
\item \code{original_data}: The input \code{data} with standardized column names
\item \code{adjusted_data}: Present only if time adjustments were applied
\item \code{method}: The method used for calculation
}

For \code{method = "sci"}:
\itemize{
\item \code{mcc_final}: A tibble with columns for \code{time} and MCC (expressed as \code{SumCIs})
\item \code{sci_table}: A tibble with cumulative incidence for each event number and their sum
\item \code{all_cis}: A list of cumulative incidence data for each event number
\item \code{mcc_base}: A tibble with calculation details for the MCC
\item \code{original_data}: The input \code{data} with standardized column names
\item \code{adjusted_data}: Present only if time adjustments were applied
\item \code{method}: The \code{method} used for calculation
}

When \code{include_details = FALSE}, a simplified list containing only:
\itemize{
\item \code{mcc_final}: A tibble with columns for \code{time} and \code{mcc} (or \code{SumCIs} for \code{method = "sci"})
\item \code{method}: The method used for calculation
}

When \code{by} is specified (grouped analysis):

A list with the same structure as above, but with an additional \code{by_group}
component and all tibbles containing an additional column with the grouping
variable values. The \code{by_group} component contains the name of the grouping
variable for reference.

\description{
Calculates the Mean Cumulative Count (MCC), which estimates the expected
cumulative number of events per person over time, while accounting for
potential competing risks and censoring. This function provides a unified
interface to two different estimation approaches: the \code{"equation"} method and
the sum of cumulative incidence (\code{"sci"}) method.

The \code{"equation"} method calculates MCC directly through probability
calculations, while the \code{"sci"} method derives MCC by summing the cumulative
incidence functions for each recurrent event. The two approaches yield
equivalent results in certain circumstances. When they do not, the choice
between methods depends on the specific outcome, analysis needs, and data
structure.

# Attach dplyr
library(dplyr)
# Create sample data with recurrent events
df <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5),
  time = c(8, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 3), # Times will be adjusted for id = 5
  cause = c(0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2)
 ) |>
  arrange(id, time)  # Sort the data by id and time

# Print the dataset
print("Hypothetical dataset from Dong et al. (2015):")
print(df)

# Calculate MCC using the equation method (default)
mcc_eq <- mcc(df, id_var = "id", time_var = "time", cause_var = "cause")

# MCC table
mcc_eq$mcc_table

# MCC estimates
mcc_eq$mcc_final


# Calculate MCC using the sum of cumulative incidence method
mcc_sci <- mcc(
  df,
  id_var = "id",
  time_var = "time",
  cause_var = "cause",
  method = "sci"
)

# MCC (SCI) table
mcc_sci$sci_table

# MCC estimates
mcc_sci$mcc_final

# Clean up
rm(df)
rm(mcc_eq)
rm(mcc_sci)
