Description: Provides tools for estimating the Mean Cumulative Count
    (MCC), a statistical method for quantifying the burden of recurrent
    events in the presence of competing risks. The package implements two
    complementary estimation approaches: the direct probability-based
    'equation' method and the 'sum of cumulative incidence' method. Both
    approaches handle right censoring, with additional support for left
    truncation in the latter. Features include automatic adjustment for
    simultaneous events, detailed calculation tables, and utilities for
    bootstrapping confidence intervals. Methods are implemented following
    Dong et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwu289>.
