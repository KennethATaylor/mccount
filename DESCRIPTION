Description: Calculates mean cumulative count (MCC) to estimate the expected 
    cumulative number of recurrent events per person over time in the presence of 
    competing risks and censoring. Implements both the Dong-Yasui equation method 
    and sum of cumulative incidence method described in Dong et al. (2015) 
    <doi:10.1093/aje/kwu289>. Supports inverse probability weighting for causal 
    inference as outlined in Gaber et al. (2023) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwad031>. 
    Provides S3 classes with methods for printing, summarizing, plotting, and 
    extracting results. Handles grouped analyses and integrates with 'ggplot2' 
    for visualization.
